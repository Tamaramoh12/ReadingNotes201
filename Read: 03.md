# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## Lists in HTML.

**List Types**

**1. Order Lists**

The ordered list is created with the \<ol> element, and we use it whenever we need a numbered list, to follow the steps one by one or for any other reason.

**2. Unorder Lists**

The unordered list is created with the \<ul> element. and it begins with a bullet point or other characters like circle point or square point.

**Note:** Each item in the ordered or unordered lists is placed between an opening \<li> tag and a closing \</li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)

**3. Definition Lists**

It is the type of lists that made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. and it is created with the \<dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
  
Inside the \<dl> element we use pairs of \<dt> and \<dd> elements.

\<dt> is used to contain the definition term.

\<dd> is used to contain the definition.

**Nested Lists**

we can put list inside one another.
