## HTML Images

**How to choose the right image?**

Images should be:

- relevant

- Convey information

- Convey the right mood
 
- Be instantly recognisable
 
- Fit the color palette

**Tip:** if you build you site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses. such as the folders you create to manage CSS and JavaScript files.

**How to add an image to the site?**

we put the <img> tag which have only open tag, and inside it we put essintial two attributes which are src and alt.

- src: refers to the images' place.

- This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

In addition to the src and alt we also have an optional attributes. such as:

- title: You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

- height: specifies the height of the image in pixels.

- width: specifies the width of the image in pixels.

- align: The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images. 

The align attribute can take either right or left value. [Note: we use this values to align the images horizontally]


The align attribute can take one of three values (top - middle - bottom) if we want to align the images vertically]

**Where to Place Image in Your Code?**

The image place will affect how the code will display.

Example:

1. before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.

2. inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.

3. in the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

Example: [Example](ul.PNG) , [The result](img result.PNG)

**Three Rules for Creating Images**

1. Save images in the right **format**.

2. Save images at the right **size**.

3. Use the correct **resolution**.

**Tools to Edit & Save Images**

1. Software Programs:

- Adobe Fireworks

- Pixelmator

- PaintShop Pro

- Paint.net

2. Online Editors
- www.photoshop.com

- www.pixlr.com

- www.splashup.com

- www.ipiccy.com

3. Online extra

- Watch videos that demonstrate how to resize images and save them in the correct format using both of these applications.

**Tips to decide which format to use**

- Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a JPEG.
A photograph that features snow or an vercast sky might look like it has large areas that are just white or gray, but the picture is usually made up of many different
colors that are subtly different.

- Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

**Image Dimensions**

The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.

When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.

Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.

Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

**More about images**

Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.

Creating an image that is partially transparent (or "see-through") for the web involves selecting one of two formats: Transparent GIF or PNG


**Some from HTML5**

Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new \<figure> element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated. 

You can have more than one image inside the \<figure> element as long as they all share
the same caption.

The \<figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.
