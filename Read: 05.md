## HTML Images

**How to choose the right image?**

Images should be:

- relevant

- Convey information

- Convey the right mood
 
- Be instantly recognisable
 
- Fit the color palette

**Tip:** if you build you site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses. such as the folders you create to manage CSS and JavaScript files.

**How to add an image to the site?**

we put the <img> tag which have only open tag, and inside it we put essintial two attributes which are src and alt.

- src: refers to the images' place.

- This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

In addition the the src and alt we also have an optional attributes. such as:

- title: You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

- height: specifies the height of the image in pixels.

- width: specifies the width of the image in pixels.

**Where to Place Image in Your Code?**

The image place will affect how the code will display.

Example:

1. before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.

2. inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.

3. in the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

Example: [the code](ol.PNG) , [The result](ol.PNG)
