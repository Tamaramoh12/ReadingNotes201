# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

### HTML Links
links are important because it enables the very idea of browsing or surfing. It allow you to move from one web page to another.

**how to write the link statement in HTML page?**

\<a href="http://www.google.com"> Google \</a>

we use the previous syntax if we want to link to other web site, but if want tp link to a page in the same project we just write the  page name.extension instead of http... , like:

\<a href="contact.html"> Contact us \</a>

notice that the content between the open and close tag is the words that the user will click on, to open the link. 

if we want to link with a file outside the folder that we are in, we just put double dots and backslash (../) before the link.

such as: \<a href="../contact.html"> Contact us \</a>
