# Introduction to HTML + CSS

HTML & CSS are about how websites are created, but before that we need to learn and know some **terminologies** in the context of web sites design and development.

- Browsers: The software that users use to access websites. 

Examples of browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

How can people view the web page?
1. type a web address into their browser.
2. follow a link from another site.
3. use a bookmark.

- Web Servers: a special computer that hosts the website. In a simple way, when you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the internet to the web server. 

Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them.

Some big companies run their own web servers, but it is more common to use the services of a web hosting company who charge a fee to host your site.

- Devices: People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. 

- Screen Readers: programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments. It is also useful to people who are unable to read a screen, such as when they are driving or jogging.
